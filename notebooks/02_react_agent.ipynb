    "# 🧠 Advanced Agent Architectures: The ReAct Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the ReAct (Reason + Act) pattern, the industry standard for building reliable autonomous agents. Unlike simple agents, a ReAct agent explicitly \"thinks\" before it acts and observes the results of its actions to decide its next move.\n",

    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Manual Loop:** Understand the mechanics of the Think-Act-Observe cycle.\n",
    "* **Reasoning Extraction:** Learn how to capture and display the agent's internal thought process.\n",
    "* **Safety & Control:** Implement iteration limits to prevent infinite loops and manage costs.\n",
