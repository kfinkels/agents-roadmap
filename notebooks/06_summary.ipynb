    "# 🎓 The Agentic Architect's Handbook\n",

    "Congratulations! You have completed the journey from a basic function-caller to a strategic planner. This summary serves as your quick-reference guide for building production-grade AI agents.\n",

    "## 🏛️ The Three Pillars of Agent Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Simple Agent (The Specialist)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern:** `User Request → Tool Call → Final Answer`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Best for:** High-speed, low-cost tasks with no ambiguity.\n",
    "* **Logic:** One-shot execution.\n",
    "* **Example:** \"What is the status of order ORD123?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The ReAct Agent (The Explorer)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern:** `Think → Act → Observe ↺`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Best for:** Tasks requiring discovery or handling unpredictable tool outputs.\n",
    "* **Logic:** Autonomous reasoning loop that decides when it has enough info to stop.\n",
    "* **Example:** \"Find my orders and refund the ones that arrived damaged.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Planning Agent (The Strategist)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern:** `Draft Plan → Execute Plan → Final Report`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Best for:** Complex, multi-step business processes requiring high reliability.\n",
    "* **Logic:** Separation of Concerns (Architect vs. Worker).\n",
    "* **Example:** \"Perform a monthly inventory audit and restock all high-performing electronics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Moving to Production: Top 5 Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always Set Guardrails:** Never run an agent without a `max_iterations` limit. An \"Infinite Loop\" is an \"Infinite Bill.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prompt Engineering is Code:** Treat your System Prompts as source code. Version them, test them, and keep them specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool Granularity:** Give your agent small, specific tools rather than one \"Do Everything\" tool. It reduces hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Human-in-the-Loop:** For Planning Agents, consider adding a \"Wait for Approval\" step after the Plan is generated but before Execution starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Logging is Non-Negotiable:** You cannot debug an agent if you can't see its \"Thoughts.\" Always print or log the reasoning blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Final Challenge: The \"Super Agent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the skills, try building a **Hybrid Agent:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the **Planner** to outline a 3-step strategy for a complex task.\n",
    "2. For each step in that plan, launch a **ReAct loop** to handle the actual execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎉 **You are now ready to build the next generation of AI-powered software!** 🚀"
